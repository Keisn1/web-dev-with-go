#+startup: overview


- take a list of migration steps and run them in predetermined order
  - e.g. series of files ordered by name
- have version associated with each migration file
- version is used to track whether it has been run or not
- filename used to help devs understand what happens
- common way is to use a table for that
#+begin_src sql
create table migrations (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
version TEXT UNIQUE
);
#+end_src
* undoing
- migrations run undo code
- remove entry from the migrations table
- undo steps often provided via
  - separate file with a suffix to notate whether it is a migration or a rollback step
  - part of the migration file with special comments to notate which part is the migration, and which part is the rollback step
* naming schema
- 001-create_users.up.sql
- 001-create_users.down.sql
* comment syntax
#+begin_src sql
-- +goose Up
CREATE TABLE users (..)

-- +goose Down
DROP TABLE users;
#+end_src
